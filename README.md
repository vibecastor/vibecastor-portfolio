## Welcome to my portfolio site!

### Philosophy
I built this site to learn more about Gatsby and well as hone my skills with GraphQL, CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts.  Many developers just use an html/css template off the internet to build their portfolio's.  I choose not to follow that path as I look for every opportunity to learn by doing.

### What's Gatsby and why did you use it?  
Gatsby is an open source framework that utilizes React, GraphQL and a number of other super cool technologies to create both static as well as dynamic web applications.  Gatsby's main advantage is speed.  This site is fast!

#### This portfolio is built with some of my favorite technologies.  

- React.js: "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces"
- Gatsby.js:  "Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps"
- GraphQL:  "GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data..."
- styled-components:  "Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress"
- Material Design:  "Material Design is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation of technology and science."
